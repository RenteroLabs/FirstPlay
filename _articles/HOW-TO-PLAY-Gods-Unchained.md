# HOW TO PLAY Gods Unchained

*Greetings, Mortal!*

*Citadel Herald here! At your service.*

It seems you’re ready to join the exciting community of Gods Unchained and begin your journey to triumph. We know that at first glance, all the cards, their effects, and the in-game mechanics may seem complicated, but with enough time, you’ll be able to master all the tools in your arsenal!

Welcome to a “How To Play” guide for Gods Unchained.

In this article, we’ll go over 3 main sections:

+ Preparing For Battle – Playing the tutorial matches and choosing your starter deck. Picking a loadout to suit your style.
+ Drawing First Blood – The first game against the AI, experimentation with other decks, and the multiplayer experience.
+ Reaping The Rewards – Opening packs at the temple, creating custom decks, embracing the call for battle.But before this, let’s quickly revisit the first step, setting up the game. If you already have the game installed, skip the upcoming section.

## 1. Setting Up The Game

This section will go over the initial installation and registration. If you want to learn how to create a wallet and link it to your account, visit our Five Steps Before You Play Starter Guide. Confident Mortals can go to Registration and Download and jump right in.

### To create an account:

Go to the Gods Unchained website. 

Enter a valid email address and create a password.

Fill in all the required information, then click “Next & Download.” the setup application will start downloading automatically.

Choose a username, and remember, it can always be changed later.

Verify your account via a confirmation email sent to your inbox.

### To install the game:

Click on the installation file, currently named “Gods+unchained+setup,” and press run.

Log in with your email address and password.

After logging in, press the update button on the left side of the game client.

Technically, this is all you need to play the game. However, we strongly recommend installing a crypto wallet like Metamask and linking it to your Gods Unchained account. You will not be able to trade (buy or sell cards) without a linked wallet. You will also miss core gameplay mechanics like Fusing in the Forge, Weekend Ranked, and Daily Play & Earn. Check our guide explaining how to install and use a wallet quickly.

### Preparing For Battle

With installation out of the way, let’s finally get into the game. You’ll have 4 game modes to choose from.

We recommend getting used to the game by playing a couple of solo matches against the computer by selecting Solo. Later, you can join the exciting multiplay Arena with the Ranked option or even challenge a friend via the Direct Challenge mode.

### Tutorial: Learning The Basics

Naturally, the first step is to pass the tutorial missions. The tutorial missions in the Arena menu will give you a quick introduction to the basic controls.

Completing the available missions will also award you Card Packs. The tutorial will automatically give you a preset deck and guide you through the battle. Once complete, you can move on to selecting your own decks.

### Fighting With Style

You probably noticed the “Choose Loadout” button if you have scrolled around the Arena. Purely for cosmetic purposes, you can choose Boards and Trinkets.

After unlocking them, you can mix, match, and find the design most pleasing to your eye.

## 2. Drawing First Blood

Done with the preparations? Good, let’s get into the action.

**Picking A Deck And Heading To Battle**

When first starting out, it’s obvious that one wouldn’t be able to assemble a powerful deck. A decent amount of game knowledge and experience will be necessary before you can start experimenting on your own. For this reason, our designers and professional TCG (trading card game) players have created 6 Starter Decks, each dedicated to a single god. Let’s try one out against the AI.

![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qyzsspeFLRnMRG8c8fCLsmq4m09hUL0pXAUuv5VYpF9Q_WYDnbqWBiRu1SzCahkg4pChlD2Dh-euqJOPSihMWjEZIMnSUWFXQ_Hx7x0XBYBo2n0_ynzcMw5n9_MX1I0dvc43lpp82EN6nN4VdFFNbF8)

First, select “Solo” mode in the Arena and click “Choose Deck.”

![img](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/5WHsQ7LJcO48TexExgoSUfrBghAeGXZS4bqo-A2YpKpwRJl6Ivv7x1RchqG9iONGNqAsZUMR00swp5mFwdX5_PPtr0Syu3yTR4xYeITI4GgkiAZfKILgNUuIKxZ8ksCSYD-1u_g23pjvZWsqEf8ANP4)


Select the deck that caught your eye, and then do the same for your opponent. As a first deck, you might want to choose either the Light Starter or the Nature Starter for yourself, as they focus on early-game action and battlefield control. Start the battle and go wild.

Feel like the tutorial and the practice matches weren’t enough? No worries. We’ve made a video to guide you further into the game mechanics.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2PtC76k4b0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2PtC76k4b0)

Remember, experimentation is key. Play around with the starter decks, and find the one most suited to your style. Implement those strategies and your preferred cards into future custom decks.

### Test Your Skills: Ranked Matches

When you feel confident in your skills, it’s time to challenge like-minded players worldwide. Head back to the Arena, but go for the Ranked game this time.

You can still choose your deck and loadout, and you might want to make a custom deck before you go into Ranked; however, you won’t know anything about your enemy’s deck. Take a deep breath, and jump into action!

## 3. Reaping The Rewards

Just by playing the game, no matter win or lose, you will gain experience and level up. With each level, you’ll receive Card Packs as a reward.

These packs can help you expand your arsenal and build viable decks, so don’t miss out on them.

When you receive a card pack, head to the temple to open them. To do that, click on “Open Packs” from the top menu.

*To open the packs:*

+ Drag your available packs from the left to the altar.
+ Click on each card to reveal what you have opened.
+ If more than one pack is available, click “Next Pack” to open the rest.

You can always supplement your arsenal by buying additional packs from Expansion Sets from the store. Either click “Buy Packs” from the game client or head to the Gods Unchained Store.

### Hone Your Weapons

When you start getting the hang of the game, you will most likely amass a sizeable collection of cards. You will definitely want to keep track of your arsenal, and to do that, head to the “Collections” tab.

Here you can see all your cards, Boards, and Trinkets.

Creating custom decks will take minimal effort as well.

To make a custom deck:

+ Click on “Workshop.”
+ Click “Create deck.”
+ Select the god you want to dedicate it to.
+ Navigate and select the cards you wish to by using the available filters.
+ Click “Save deck” to finalize your creation.
