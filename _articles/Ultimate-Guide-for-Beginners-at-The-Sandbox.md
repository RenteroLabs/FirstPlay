One of the world's largest independent user-generated content and gaming platforms with 40 million downloads and over 1 million monthly active users. It is building a unique virtual world where players can use SAND (ERC-20), LAND (representing digital real estate NFT in The Sandbox metaverse).

The Sandbox is a unique virtual world game, it can be said that it is like "Minecraft" on the chain; in the world of The Sandbox, you can obtain non-homogeneous tokens (NFT ) LAND, to unlock real estate, land, etc. in the game.

Let's quickly get to know The Sandbox with this [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oi1mis3DGZE)

## What is LAND?

LAND is digital real estate in The Sandbox metaverse that players can purchase, and once they own a LAND, they can add games and assets to it.

There are a total of 166,464 LANDs that exist forever and are included in the map of The Sandbox metaverse.

Each LAND is an NFT (ERC-721) non-fungible token .

Two different types are available on The Sandbox map:

+ LAND: The basic sandbox unit on the map. Each LAND in the game world consists of 96 x 96 meters large enough to realize all types of blockchain gaming experience. 

+ ESTATE: An ESTATE is a combination of multiple LANDS.

## What can LAND be used for?

(1) Use it to play and create your own worldLAND is a ticket to enter this virtual world. Not only can you build your own space, but it can also become a world where you can bring friends to play, explore and experience social interaction.

(2) Earn profit from itLAND can monetize the gaming experience in various ways. For example: I built my space to look like the God of Creation. Some people would like to visit it, so they can use this to charge other people to visit. I think people who have played Animal Crossing should be familiar with this point.In addition, you can define how to get profit by yourself, or set the way to charge for playing games.

(3) Participate in the governance of MetaverseOwnership of LAND allows you to play a role in the governance of The Sandbox, participate and co-define the future of the platform!

(4) Organize competitions and events, and then get rewards.In the future, The Sandbox will have the opportunity to hold various competitions or activities. According to the content of the activities, if you win or rank among the best, you may have a chance to get good rewards!

## What should I pay attention to when purchasing LAND?

In fact, the most important point is only this: in order for your land to become a region, it must meet the following conditions:

Your LAND must be next door (adjacent), and must have at least 2 unique owners, and each involved owner must invest a certain amount of SAND.

Small reminder: As mentioned earlier, there are a total of 166,464 LAND spaces, and currently about 5% of the space has been sold. If you want to buy LAND in the future, they will announce the launch time on the official community, remember to follow them at any time! (Official information is placed in the bottom reference)

### SAND

To put it simply, SAND can be understood as gold coins in the game, which can be obtained by playing games, or buying some equipment (characters) and the like. It is a common language in this game (game gold coins).

The part about governance is similar to the concept of LAND, allowing token owners to participate in governance decisions. He can choose to vote for himself or for others.

The last gameplay allows players to stake tokens to get rewards: gems and catalysts (things used to create assets).
